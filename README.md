## The Simpsons meets Data Visualization

There are few things I love more than _The Simpsons_. It is one of those shows that I think about on a daily basis. With thirty seasons and over 600 episodes, the animated comedy show holds a special place in my heart. Every so often, I find myself singing along when _Mr. Plow_ or _Everybody Hates Ned Flanders_ gets stuck in my head.

This reposity contains the data and code for creating lot's of fun visualizations.
